Spring Boot : JPA
-----------------
JPA : Java Persistence API
      You store the information in the database.
	  spring-boot-starter-data-jpa : dependency.
	  We are using hibernate as JPA.
Hibernate: is a java based framework, It is an ORM tool.
           Object Relational Mapping Tool.

One to One Mapping
We are taking example of address and Customer
In which One Customer belongs to one address.


Primary Key : Promary key is a unique key for a table.It's value can't be null.
              So that we can't put the dulicate record in the table.

Foreign Key : is the primary key for another table.
              


drop database if exists customer_db;
create database customer_db;
use customer_db;
create table address(
	address_id int ,
	street varchar(30) not null,
	city varchar(10) not null,
	constraint ps_addressid_pk primary key (address_id)
);
insert into address values(100,'8 East Walnut Street', 'New York');
insert into address values(101,'720 Rockland Road', 'Las Vegas');
insert into address values(102,'37 Marlborough Street', 'Gallup');

create table customer (
	customer_id int auto_increment,
	address_id int unique,
	emailid varchar(25) not null,
	name varchar(10) not null,
	date_of_birth date not null,
	constraint ps_customerid_pk primary key (customer_id),
	constraint ps_customer_address_fk foreign key(address_id) references address(address_id)
);
insert into customer values (1234,100,'james01@infosys.com', 'James', sysdate()-interval 7476 day);
insert into customer values (1235, 101,'william@infosys.com', 'William', sysdate()-interval 11374 day);
insert into customer values (1236, 102,'antony_04@infosys.com', 'Antony', sysdate()-interval 12344 day);
commit;
select * from customer;
select * from address;
